# TS4 Hotkeys & Gamepad

This mod is for Windows only and does not work on any other systems.

## Issues
The hotkeys work only while a zone is loaded and the game has the focus.
It is now disabled in CAS but still active in the build/buy menu.
The cheat console and text input in game do lag.
That's because the input can't be processed fast enough due to the limited Python threading capabilities.
Get a much faster processor to fix this.

The gamepad is queried in an active thread around 25 times a second.
This adds some overhead to TS4.
Unplug or disable the gamepad to avoid this in case you don't use it.

Should be solved:
~~There are some issues to detect the focus properly.
In such cases the keys will not work.
Switch to a different window/program and back to TS4 to fix this.~~

## Hotkeys
This mod allows to define custom hotkeys for the keyboard keys [A-Z0-9].
It supports Shift, Ctrl, Alt and/or Win key modifiers.
The mod itself doesn't come with any pre-defined hotkey bindings.

## Gamepad
The mod supports using the gamepad to move sims around in case a 3rd-party mod to move objects/sims is available.
The support to route sims to a location is very basic and may throw exceptions.
Custom actions can't be bound to the gamepad keys, except of the paddle key which always act as normal keys. 
* The left stick can be used to rotate the sim.
* The left shoulder key activates the trigger keys to rotate the sim around the Y axis.
* The right stick can be used to move the sim.
* The right shoulder key activates the trigger keys to move the sim up/down (Y axis).
* The DPAD can be used to send the sim into the corresponding location. This may fail and/or throw exceptions. Please do not report any exceptions thrown while using the DPAD.
* The ABXY, menu and play keys are not yet used.
* The game key can't be used.

### Configuration
The default configuration file is placed in `mod_data/hotkeys/hotkeys.txt` and should not be edited as it will be overridden when updating.
To modify the default values copy it to `mod_data/hotkeys/hotkeys.override.txt` and change values in the new file.
#### Enable / Disable permanently
* To disable the hotkeys permanently change `'Hotkeys': True,` to `'Hotkeys': False,`.
* To disable the gamepad permanently change `'Gamepad': True,` to `'Gamepad': False,`.
* To change the gampepad ID modify `'GamepadId': 0,` to values 1, 2 or 3.

* Other settings should not be modified.

### Cheats
* o19.hk.gp.id ID - Select the controller ID (0-3) to be used. Defaults to the fist controller '0'.
* o19.hk.gp.verbose - Write a verbose log. This will cause some lag while using the controller.

## Pie Menus
### Moving Objects
There is a simple cheat interaction called 'Move'.
* Clicking on a object/(or random) sim allows to move and/or rotate the object/sim. The active sim will be ignored.
* Running it on the floor allows to move the `active` sim (default) again.


# Creation of Custom Hotkey Bindings
Replace directory, author, mod etc. (often mention in `{}` below) with real / useful values. The values and names used when creating a new mod should never contain `{` or `}`.

To add custom hotkeys to the game create a file `The Sims 4/mod_data/hotkeys/hotkeys.{author-name}.{mod-name}.txt` and add hotkey definitions to it. E.g.:
```json
{
  'author-name.mod-name': {
    'A': ['{directory}.{file-name}..{ClassName}.{function_name}', 'Description: A miracle happens.', ],
    'Shift+Ctrl+Alt+Win+A': ['{directory}.{file-name}.{ClassName}.{function_name2} {all parameters}', 'Description: Another miracle happens.', ],
  }
}
```
In case you start TS4 now `Hotkeys` will complain about the missing functions.

Create a mod with the structure from above. It should have a file `{directory}/{file-name}.py` with the following structure:
```python
class {ClassName}:
    @staticmethod
    def {function_name}():
        pass  # code for 'A miracle happens.'
    @staticmethod
    def {function_name2}(*args):
        pass  # code for 'Another miracle happens.'
```

Compile the file to `{directory}/{file-name}.pyc` and add it to a ZIP file with the .ts4script instead of the .zip file suffix.
Add the `{mod-name}.ts4script` file to the mods folder.

Starting TS4 will read the `hotkeys.{author-name}.{mod-name}.txt`, locate the methods in the mod and call it whenever one fo the keys is pressed.


# Addendum

## Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.106.148, S4CL 3.3, TS4Lib 0.3.14 (2024-04).
It is expected to be compatible with many upcoming releases of TS4, S4CL and TS4Lib.

## Dependencies
Download the ZIP file, not the sources.
* [This Mod](../../releases/latest)
* [TS4-Library](https://github.com/Oops19/TS4-Library/releases/latest)
* [S4CL](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary/releases/latest)
* [The Sims 4](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4)

If not installed download and install TS4 and these mods.
All are available for free.

## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.
