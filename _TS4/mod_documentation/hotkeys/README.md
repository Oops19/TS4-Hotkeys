# TS4 Hotkeys & Gamepad

This mod is for Windows only and does not work on any other systems.

## Hotkeys
This mod allows to define custom hotkeys for the keyboard keys [A-Z0-9].
It supports Shift, Ctrl, Alt and/or Win key modifiers.
The mod itself doesn't come with any pre-defined hotkey definitions.

## Gamepad
The mod supports using the gamepad to move sims around.
The support to route sims to a location is very basic and may throw exceptions.
Custom actions can't be bound to the gamepad keys, except of the paddle key which always act as normal keys. 
* The left stick can be used to rotate the sim.
* The left shoulder key activates the trigger keys to rotate the sim around the Y axis.
* The right stick can be used to move the sim.
* The right shoulder key activates the trigger keys to move the sim up/down (Y axis).
* The DPAD can be used to send the sim into the corresponding location. This may fail and/or throw exceptions. Please do not report any exceptions thrown while using the DPAD.
* The ABXY, menu and play keys are not yet used.
* The game key can't be used.

### Cheats
* o19.hk.gp.id ID - Select the controller ID (0-3) to be used. Defaults to the fist controller '0'.
* o19.hk.gp.verbose - Write a verbose log. This will cause some lag while using the controller.

### Moving Objects
There is a simple cheat interaction called 'Move'. Running it on the floor allows to move the `active` sim (default).
Clicking on a object/(not controlled) sim allows to move and/or rotate the object/sim.



# Addendum

## Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.106.148, S4CL 3.3, TS4Lib 0.2.0 (2024-02).
It is expected to be compatible with many upcoming releases of TS4, S4CL and TS4Lib.

## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.
