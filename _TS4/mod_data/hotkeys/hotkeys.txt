# This configuration file defines special settings for the mod itself.
# This file override the default values with the values above (which exactly match the default values) and can be deleted.
# Do not edit this file! Updates will override it.
# To override default values copy this file to 'hotkeys.override.txt' and modify the new file.

# Parameters:
# Hotkeys: bool = False .................. Disable all hotkeys and keep them disabled.
# Gamepad: bool = False .................. Disable the controller / gamepad. It can be activated later.
# GamepadId: int = 0 ..................... The ID of the controller (0-3) are supported. Change this in case you have multiple controllers connected to the PC and want to use not the 1st one.
# GamepadPollDelay: float = 0.03 ......... Wait n seconds before polling the gamepad again. Lower this value to poll more often. Polling itself also takes some time. FPS games may poll with 144 Hz or more.
# GamepadButtonRepeatRate: float = 0.5 ... Wait n seconds before sending another 'keyDown' event is a button is held down. Pressing a button faster is possible to send more 'keyDown' notifications.
# GamepadVerbose: bool = True ............ Write a verbose log file

# Cheat commands to alter some of these settings while playing:
# 'o19.hk.gp.enable'
# 'o19.hk.gp.id $GamepadId'
# 'o19.hk.gp.poll_delay $GamepadPollDelay'
# 'o19.hk.gp.button_repeat_rate $GamepadButtonRepeatRate'
# 'o19.hk.gp.verbose'
